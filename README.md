# Tic-Tac-Toe üéÆ

A simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game implemented in **C++**. Play against another player or challenge the AI!

## Features ‚ú®
- **Two-player mode** (Classic Tic-Tac-Toe)
- **AI mode** (Uses Minimax algorithm for smart moves)
- **Simple command-line interface**
- **Win detection & draw handling**

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è
The game board is a **3x3 grid** where:
- Player **X** and **O** take turns marking their spots.
- The game detects **winning conditions** (rows, columns, diagonals).
- If the board fills up with no winner, it's a **draw**.

The AI (if enabled) uses the **Minimax algorithm** to choose the best possible move.
